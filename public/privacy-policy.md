## 7. ANALYTICS AND CONSENT

### 7.1 How Analytics Work

By default, when you use the App, Firebase Analytics collects pseudonymized usage data to help us understand how the app is used and improve it. This includes:
- Device identifiers (not linked to your name or email)
- App screens visited and features used
- Session duration and frequency
- Technical performance metrics

**Privacy Protections We've Enabled:**
- IP Address Anonymization: Enabled
- Google Signals: Disabled
- Ad Personalization: Disabled
- Data Retention: Set to 2 months (shortest available)

### 7.2 Your Control Over Analytics

**For All Users:**
You can disable analytics at any time through the app:
1. Go to **Settings** in the App
2. Find **"Analytics"** toggle
3. Turn it **Off** to stop sending usage data

**What This Means:**
- **Enabled (default):** We collect pseudonymized usage data to improve the app. No personal identifiers like your name or email are used.
- **Disabled:** The app will not send any usage or analytics data. Core app features will continue to work normally.

**For EEA/UK Residents:**
While analytics run by default, we want to be transparent:
- Device identifiers are used, which can be considered personal data under GDPR
- You have the right to opt out at any time using the in-app toggle
- Disabling analytics does not affect any app functionality
- Your choice is stored locally on your device and persists across app updates

**Note:** Even with analytics disabled, we may still collect minimal technical data necessary for app operation (authentication tokens, crash prevention), but this is not used for analytics purposes.

---

## 8. DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY

### 8.1 Where Your Data is Stored

**On-Device Storage (Local):**
- Fetal heartbeat audio recordings are stored exclusively on your iPhone
- HealthKit data remains in Apple's Health app on your device
- App settings and preferences
- iCloud sync status metadata (processed on-device only, not transmitted to servers)

**iCloud Storage (Optional):**
- When you enable iCloud sync, your pregnancy journey data (moments, notes, recordings) is stored in your personal iCloud account
- This data is encrypted by Apple using industry-standard encryption
- CloudKit encryption keys are managed entirely by Apple; we do not operate or have access to client-side end-to-end encryption keys
- We do not have access to your iCloud data; only you control it through your Apple ID

**Firebase/Cloud Storage:**
- Account authentication tokens
- Pseudonymized analytics data (device IDs, usage patterns)
- Data is stored in Firebase servers located in the **Asia-Pacific region**

### 8.2 Security Measures

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information:

**Technical Safeguards:**
- Encryption in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher for all data transmissions
- Encryption at rest provided by Apple (iCloud) and Google Cloud Platform (Firebase)
- Secure authentication via Apple Sign-In with token-based access
- Native Apple CloudKit encryption with keys managed by Apple

**Organizational Safeguards:**
- Access to personal data is limited to team members who need it for legitimate purposes
- Regular security assessments and updates
- Incident response procedures in place

**Important Clarification:**
We use Apple's default CloudKit encryption for iCloud storage and Firebase's default encryption. Data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. CloudKit encryption keys are managed by Apple, and we do not implement additional client-side end-to-end encryption beyond Apple's and Firebase's standard protections.

### 8.3 Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

Given that we process sensitive health data (fetal heartbeat recordings, heart rate, pregnancy information), we periodically assess privacy risks and implement appropriate safeguards. As our app evolves and our user base grows, we will conduct formal Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) and publish summaries of our findings and mitigations when available.

### 8.4 Data Breach Notification

In the event of a data breach that poses a risk to your rights and freedoms, we will:
- Notify affected users within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach (GDPR requirement)
- Notify the relevant supervisory authority as required by law

## 9. DATA SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

### 9.1 We Do Not Sell Your Data

We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.

### 9.2 Sharing with Service Providers (Data Processors)

We share limited information with trusted third-party service providers who process data on our behalf under strict contractual obligations:

**Firebase (Google LLC):**
- **Purpose:** App analytics, authentication, and cloud infrastructure
- **Data Shared:** Pseudonymized device identifiers, app usage events, authentication tokens
- **Configuration:** 
  - Google Signals: Disabled
  - Ad Personalization: Disabled
  - IP Anonymization: Enabled
  - Data Retention: Set to 2 months (shortest available)
- **What is NOT shared:** Your name, email, fetal heartbeat recordings, HealthKit data, or any personally identifiable health information
- **Privacy Policy:** https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
- **Location:** Data stored in Asia-Pacific region servers
- **Redundancy:** Data may be redundantly stored by Google across multiple geographic locations for reliability and disaster recovery purposes

**Apple Inc.:**
- **Purpose:** Authentication (Apple Sign-In), cloud storage (iCloud), device integration (Apple Watch), health data (HealthKit)
- **Data Shared:** 
  - Apple Sign-In: Authentication token, email (or private relay email)
  - iCloud: User-created content (moments, notes, recordings) stored in your personal iCloud account
  - HealthKit: Heart rate data (read-only, remains on device)
- **Your Control:** You control iCloud and HealthKit access through iOS settings
- **Privacy Policy:** https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/
- **Location:** Apple services may process data in the United States and other countries where Apple operates

**SDK Registry:**
We currently use only Firebase and Apple system frameworks (CloudKit, HealthKit, Sign-In with Apple). We do not integrate any additional third-party SDKs, advertising networks, or tracking libraries. If we add new SDKs in the future, we will update this section and notify users via email.

**Important:** Firebase Analytics data is pseudonymized, meaning it uses device identifiers rather than your name or email. However, this is not fully anonymous data, as device IDs can potentially be linked to individuals. We have configured Firebase to maximize privacy by disabling ad personalization, enabling IP anonymization, and minimizing data retention.

### 9.3 Companion Account Sharing

When you add a companion account (partner):
- The companion can view and read all pregnancy moments and recordings you create
- The companion can create new moments that you can see
- The companion can share moments through the app's sharing features
- **The companion can export recordings and moments to their local device** through standard iOS sharing (save to Files, share via Messages, etc.)
- The companion cannot delete your data or moments
- If the companion saves or exports recordings to their local device before you revoke access, they retain those local copies
- **Revoking companion access does not delete content the companion has already exported or saved locally**
- You can revoke companion access at any time through app settings, which immediately logs out the companion from all devices
- No notification is sent to the companion when access is revoked

**Companion Export Notifications (Optional Feature):**
- If technically feasible in a future update, we will add an optional alert that notifies the main account when a companion exports or shares content
- You will be able to view a simple audit log of companion activity (what was viewed, shared, or exported) in the app settings

**Privacy and Safety Notice:** Be cautious when granting companion access. Only share access with trusted partners. If you are in a situation where sharing may compromise your safety or privacy, do not enable companion features. Revoking access prevents future access but does not delete content already saved by the companion.

### 9.4 Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to:
- Valid legal process (court orders, subpoenas, warrants)
- Requests from law enforcement or government authorities
- Protection of our legal rights, property, or safety
- Prevention of fraud, security threats, or illegal activity
